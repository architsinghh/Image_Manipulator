# Image Processing and Computer Vision Application

## Project Overview
This project is an advanced image processing and computer vision application designed to facilitate **object detection**, **region translation**, and **connected-component analysis**. Built using **C++** and **OpenCV**, the application provides efficient tools for image manipulation, segmentation, and labeling.

---

### Features
- **Object Detection**: Automatically identify and label distinct objects in an image using connected-component analysis.
- **Region Translation**: Translate a user-specified region of an image to a new location while maintaining visual consistency.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Real-time rendering of image edits, including translated regions and labeled components.
- **Scalable Performance**: Handles images up to 4K resolution with optimized memory management for variable image sizes.

### Technologies Used
- **Language**: C++  
- **Libraries**: OpenCV (v4.x)  
- **Build Tool**: Makefile
